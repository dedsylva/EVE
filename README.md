# EVE
 
## The next step for healthcare.


EVE is an App designed by Dedsylva, with the intention of showing the possibiilities of current technology towards HealthCare. 

<b>This APP has no intention to be comercialized. </b>

Healthcare has become one of the most important problems of our society, and one way to resolve it is by making things cheap.
In order to do that, we need to start implementing what has been called by me <i>Home Testing</i> and <i>HealthDataCare</i>.

The concept is simple: instead of making people pay (when they can) and wait in a long line for exams, we make tests at home. <u>Cheap and effective</u> tests. Current there is a few applications that HealthCare already can take benefits from. They are called
<b>Simple Daily Data:</b>
 - Those are the data that can already be taken from home. For example: Weight Measures, Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, etc.

But we can go further and enable a new class of exams: <b>Cancer Exams</b>. This is a sensitive topic, but it has a lot of potential.
Imagine if you can make a quick and simple test at home and know in a couple minutes the likelihood that you have cancer.
This is already possible with at least two types: <i>Skin Cancer and Breast Cancer</i>.


## Skin cancer
------
The way to do it is pretty simple, and it is implemented with this app. You just take a picture, fill some informations
about the image (your age, sex, location of the photo taken) and we have about 92% of precision in less than a minute.
There are ways to improve this results, if you use a dermatology photo (one way implemented is having a microscopic.

## Breast cancer
------
This is a little more tricky. The software is done, and it works similarly to the Skin Cancer. You simply present the image to the model
and it does the inference. But the best way of taking "picture" is with a ultrassonic transducer, which are (currently) too expensive.
What we need to do is to redesign the ultrassonic transducer, making it more easy and reliable for common people to use, and be able to
make the test at home.


## To Note
------
It is important to note that <b>this does not mean that you are not going to need a doctor</b>. This is just a <i>pre-test</i> that will need to be
confirmed by a medical professional. The point here is not to replace Doctors, but instead <i>help</i> them providing <u>more data</u>, and
making easier for common people to have diagnostics faster and cheaper.

While in that note, talking about sharing data to doctors, this is the other pillar that this app is based on. Its time that the pacient
has control over their entire Medical History, since the day he/she were born. No more retaking tests because they were made by another
Private Hospital (obligating people to pay for another exam). If you have the data, the doctor can make the diagnose better and more
precisely (imagine two scenarios: pacient A comes to doctor not feeling good for a few days, and pacient B who is suffering the same
syntoms, but has their Medical History available and Daily/Weekly data of their Health Status. The doctor can then study those informations
and make a more conscious decision with the last pacient).
